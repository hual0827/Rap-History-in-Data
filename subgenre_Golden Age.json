get a cut cuz my rents a month late product of a north carolina cat who scratched the back of a pretty woman named hattie who departed life just a little too soon and didnt see me grab the plug tune fame as we go a little somethin like this look ma no protection now i got a daughter named ayana monet and i can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay i am an early bird but the feathers are black so the apples that i catch are usually all worms but its a must to decipher ones queen from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ i cherish the twilight i maximize my soul is the right size i watch for the power to run out on the moon and thatll be sometime soon faker than a fist of kids speakin that theyre black when theyre just niggas trying to be greek or some tongues who lied and said well be natives to the end nowadays we dont even speak i guess we got our own life to live or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule every now and then i step to the now for now i see back then i might have acted like a fool now i wont apologize for it this is not a bunch of bradys but a bunch of black mans pride yet i can safely say ive never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside ive always walked the right side of the road if i wasnt making song i wouldnt be a thug selling drugs but a man with a plan and if i was a rug cleaner betcha posd have the cleanest rugs i am the plug two brand with the flavour in the flute watch the sniffin so a sack of shows in demand i read the diction from the second page i got the one two gauge baritone to the izm fan trees fall so i can play ground with my ink so let me need ya to my ems go i push the infinite and carry it my carriers the three over one so my pluggins already know lick shots with moo catch the boo from a ghost in the heckling crowd if i give a foot jack ville caught a spill when a still came from my mouth i brought a head down south i dont check for the noose and the neck so i never tell my ems that finesse is knocking at my door i choose to run from the rays of the burning sun and dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore i bring the element h with the 2 so ya owe me whats coming when im raining on your new parade its just mind over matter and what matters is that the mind isnt guided by the punished shade i keep the walking on the right side but i wont judge the next who handles walking on the wrong cuz thats how he wants to be no difference see i wanna be like the name of this song i am you might also like i am posdnous i be the new generation of slaves here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes the pile of revenue i create but i guess i dont get a cut cuz my rents a month late the deeds of a natural are seeds that are no longer planted so the famine in the mind is strong tactics of another plane is now proven sane sane enough to let you know from within this song i stabilize many cableized viewers so my

or a written down memo see i am a professional this is not a demo in fact call it a lecture a visual picture sort of a poetic and rhythm like mixture listen im not dissing but theres something that youre missing maybe you should touch reality stop wishing for beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste if this meaning doesnt manifest put it to rest i am a poet you try to show it yet blow it it takes concentration for fresh communication observation that is to see without speaking take off your coat take notes i am teaching a class or rather school cause you need schooling i am not a king or queen im not ruling this is an introduction to poetry a small dedication to those that might know of me they might know of you and maybe your gang but one things for sure neither one of yall can hang cause yo im like a arrow and scott is the crossbow say something now thought so you seem to be the type that only understand the annihilation and destruction of the next man thats not poetry that is insanity its simply fantasy far from reality poetry is the language of imagination poetry is a form of positive creation difficult isnt it the point youre missing it your face is in front of my hand so im dissing it get get get down get get get get get get get down get down  scott la rock innovating decorating hip hop the beat may drop but not like all the others they just cover while i just smother every single stupid mother wait wait brother krs one will have to show another mc or self proclaimed king or queen or gang or crew or solo or team that i mean business so tell me what is this see i come from the bronx so just kiss this boogie down productions is somewhat an experiment the antidote for sucker mcs and theyre fearing it its self explanatory no ones writing for me the poetry im rattling is really not for battling but if you want i will simply change the program so when im done you will simply say damn so this conversation is somewhat hypothetical boogie down productions

collected with the rhyme i directed dont wanna be elected as the king of a record just respected by others as the man with the solution an artist of the 80s came and left his contribution on wax relax

and it stopped at 1230 it had melted it was so darn hot and i was thirsty i went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke flipped the tv off and then i almost choked when i heard this awful voice comin from behind it said you turned off david letterman now you must die man i aint even wait to see who it was broke outside in my drawers and screamed so long cuz got halfway up the block i calmed down and stopped screamin then thought oh i get it i must be dreamin i strolled back home with a grin on my grill i figured since this is a dream i might as well get ill i walked in the house the big bad fresh prince but freddy killed all that noise real quick he grabbed me by my neck and said heres what well do we got a lot of work here me and you the souls of your friends you and i will claim youve got the body and ive got the brain i said yo fred i think youve got me all wrong i aint partners with nobody with nails that long look ill be honest man this team wont work the girls wont be on you fred your face is all burnt i pat him on the shoulder said thanks for stopping by then i opened up the door and said take care guy he got mad drew back his arm and slashed my shirt i laughed at first then thought hold up that hurt it wasnt a dream man this guy was for real i said freddy uh pal theres been an awful mistake here no further words and then i darted upstairs crashed through my door then jumped on my bed pulled the covers up over my head and said oh please do somethin with fred he jumped on my bed ripped through the covers with his claws tried to get me but my alarm went off and

chill lyrics for years i have been waitin and hesitatin to make a rap record that had the pace of a slow song quiet storm chillin while the fire is warm you and your girl with this record on your radio or stereo i dont know i love you so is what youll be sayin while this records playin you reminscin and kissin your girl relax lay back unwind because now its time to chill setting the mood by the use of this groove is an ingenious perceptive brilliant a very clever move because the bass line combined with the fresh rhyme at a slow tempo entices passion to grow but if its not passion for which you search then use the song as a massage after a hard days work and if its true that music calms the savage beast play this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep take a deep breath stretch kick off your footwear put on the tape of this record but beware caution warning its your decision theres nothin stronger that you can buy without prescription its soothing somewhat hypnotic a rhythmic anesthetic its practically a narcotic you want it  we got it    come get it were widdit because its all at the push of a button yo jeff hit it the objective of this musical extravaganza is to enlighten you stanza by stanza verse after verse have been precisely arranged rearranged and then changed until the best remained the result being this incredible song so for at least eight hours a day youll have this record on in the morning and at night in your room and all through the afternoon you will be listening mentally wrapped up in the cut some people will sit down and some will choose to get up but whatever you choose just keep your ear to the wax because we got somethin def that other rappers lack we havent been able to put our fingers on what it is but its different and its def and it appeals to kids and teens and adults and senior citizens too and id be willing to bet that it appeals to you too so if youre not into rap give us a chance to change your mind and to make you dance to this lyrical miracle this musical discovery but yo i wanna chill for a second yo jeff cover me its like paradise this music is nice it makes you hot if you want it too or twice as cold as ice

oh come come now thats quite ridiculous so just admit you was thrilled its on your face and its conspicuous not that youre on this but my performance is rather exquisite so hard is it or supremacy thats the perfect definition but rappers keep wishing to be in my position know good and damn well they aint no competition huh i gotta give it to you kid thats ambition for you to perpetrate the role of me the big daddy the big father nah dont even bother cause that would mean you would have to teach each and every one idiotic son trying to make it you cant fake it the rhymes i recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked your speech is weak while my mine stands strong so all hail the man thats here to live long  you know you heard this voice before somewhere and when i said that im the kane you said oh yeah that brother that used to rhyme on stage with biz oh hes def you know what time it is but this time im not assisted on the microphone more like patti labelle on my own just single handed the mic i commanded phony mcs dont understand it and it is the real thing like the taste of coke so never sleep on me better stay awoke like a gambler in vegas i go for broke to make a long story short yo i aint no joke i take time and care in whatever im doing and when i rock a party i make sure that you en  joy what youre hearing as i entertain so hip hip hooray long live the kane   i got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that i choose it so all hail to the music on exhibit get with it now heres my ring the original supreme being black man point blank the cream to rise

human tones it has been his aim to add breadth and depth to give realism and spaciousness and even where it applies to convey actual movement  intro i start to go my rhymesll flow so get up and dance cause kane said so if you were lounging around its time to get up pardon my expression but imma tear shit up i appear right here and scare and dare a mere musketeer that would dare to compare i do declare getting busy is where its at but what youre saying you wouldnt get a point for that cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light but i drop bass just like barry white so how

you can do to this fuck around with kane and come out black and blue for this so yo go for what you know attempt to debate so i can humiliate we can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse

get up everybody get up everybody get up everybody get up boy do i hate a im coming im coming im coming im coming im coming  here i am r a w a terrorist here to bring trouble to phony mcs i move on and seize i just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease cause im at my apex and others are below nothing but a milliliter im a kilo second to none making mcs run so dont try to step to me cause i aint the one i relieve rappers just like tylenol and they know it so i dont see why you all try to front perpetrating a stunt when you know that ill smoke you up like a blunt im genuine like gucci raw like sushi to stage a rage is what rap did to me to make me want to create chaos and mayhem cold rock a party until the am ill make a muscle grab the mic and hustle while you stand dazed and amazed i bust a little rhyme with authority superiority and captivate the whole crowds majority the rhymes i use definitely amuse better than dynasty or hill street blues im sure to score adored for more without a flaw cause i get raw you might also like everybody get up everybody get up everybody get up everybody get up everybody get up  give a speech like a reverend rappers start severing and in my lifetime believe ive never been beaten or eaten and just tooken out you know come to think about it i keep mcs looking out and real nervous when im at your service give me that title boy you dont

whatever is clever take a loss never and the rhymes i bust coming off is a must and i come off hard with rhymes that are odd i rip the microphone and leave it scarred never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff only crushing mcs that be trying to riff i get strong and titanic do work like a mechanic make mcs panic they all get frantic and skeptic like a girl on a contraceptive as i rock but hey what you expected ill get raw for you just like a warrior rapping like a samurai and ill be damned if i ever let a fisher price mc hang their rhymes are toy nothing but yin yang so if we battle on

addict addicted to music maybe its a habit i gotta use it even if its jazz or the quiet storm i hook a beat up convert it into hip hop form write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in deep concentration cause im no comedian jokers are wild if you wanna be tame i treat you like a child then youre gonna be named another enemy not even a friend of me cause youll get fried in the end when you pretend to be competing cause i just put your mind on pause and i can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned remember me the one you got your idea from but soon you start to suffer the tunell get rougher when you start to stutter thats when you had enough of biting itll make you choke you cant provoke you cant cope you shouldve broke because i aint no joke i got a question as serious as cancer who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling cause youre expressing the rhyme that im styling this is what we all sit down to write you cant make it so you take it home break it and bite use pieces and bits of all my hip hop hits get the style down pat then its time to switch put my tape on pause and add some more to yours then you figure youre ready for the neighborhood tours the e m c e e dont even try to be when you come up to speak dont even lie to me you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me so when you see me come up freeze or youll be one of those seven emcees they think that im a new jack but only if they knew that they who think wrong are they who cant do that style that im doing they might ruin patterns of paragraphs based on you and your off beat dj if anything he play sound familiar ill wait til e say play em so ima have to diss and broke you could get a smack for this i aint no joke you might also like i hold the microphone like a grudge bll hold the record so the needle dont budge i hold a conversation cause what i invent i

you know it youre following and fiending waiting for the punchline to get the meaning like before the moral of my story im telling nobody beats the r so stop yelling save it put it in your pocket for later cause im moving the crowd and bll wreck the fader no interruptions and the mic is broke when im gone then you can joke cause everything is real on a serious tip keep playing and i get furious

weak shows you slept through times up im sorry i kept you thinking of this you keep repeating you miss the rhyme from the microphone soloist so you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon as you hear it pump up the volume dance with the speaker til you hear it blow then plug in the headphone cause here it go its a four letter word when its heard it control your body to dance you got it soul di tects the tempo like a red alert reaches your reflex and let it work when this is playing you cant get stuck with the steps so get set and im a still come up with a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go def with the record that was mixed a long time ago it can be done but only i can do it for those that cant dance then clap your hands to it i start to think and then i sink into the paper like i was ink when im writing im trapped in between the lines i escape when i finish the rhyme i got soul soul you got it you got it you got it you got it i know you got soul hey if you didnt you wouldnt be in be in be in here  picture a mic the stage is empty a beat like this might tempt me to pose show my rings and my fat gold chain grab the mic like im on soul train but i wait cause i mastered this let the others go first so the brothers dont miss eric b break the sticks you got it rakim will begin when you make the mix ill experiment like a scientist you wanna rhyme you gotta sign

slide on down to my pad the vibe here is very pleasant and i truly request your presence a problem of great magnitude has arose and as we speak it grows damn what could it be i thought a juice i bought and rolled on down to her spot seeing bros i know slapping fives i arrived and pressed g 5 and there was nikki lookin some kind of sad with tears fallin from her eyes she sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down you remember my boyfriend sid that fly kid who i love well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third but due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate about this we dont feel great but baby thats how it is but the feds have dissed me they ignored and dismissed me the pro lifers harass me outside the clinic and call me a murderer now thats hate so needless to say were in a mental state of debate hey beautiful bird i said digging her somber mood the fascists are some heavy dudes they dont really give a damn about life they just dont want a woman to control her body or have the right to choose but baby that aint nothin they just want a male finger on the button because if you say war they will send them to die by the score aborting mission should be your volition but if souter and thomas have their way youll be standing in line unable to get welfare while theyll be out hunting and fishing it has always been around it will always have a niche but theyll make it a privilege not a right accessible only to the rich hey pro lifers need to dig themselves because life doesnt stop after birth and for a child born to the unprepared it might even just get worse the situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it supporters of the h bomb and fire bombing clinics what type of shit is that orwellian in fact if roe v wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact leaving young girls to risk their healths doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves now i hate to sound macabre but hey

man youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is so what you want me to do express yourself  im expressin with my full capabilities and now im livin in correctional facilities cause some dont agree with how i do this i get straight meditate like a buddhist im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary but my technique is very necessary blame it on ice cube because he says it gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one you know what i wont hesitate to diss one or two before im through so dont try to sing this some drop science well im droppin english even if yella makes it a cappella i still express yo i dont

other end watch a brother sayin dope rhymes with no help theres no fessin and guessin while im expressin myself its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be but not me ruthless is the way to go they know others say rhymes that fail to be original or they kill where the hip hop starts forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts some musicians cuss at home but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone yeah they want reality but you wont hear none theyd rather exaggerate a little fiction some say no to drugs and take a stand but after the show they go lookin for the dopeman or they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to you might also like express yourself yeah yeah yeah  express yourself come on and do it yeah yeah do it express yourself dr dre dr dre in full effect and nwa express yourself come on and do it express yourself  from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart then expression is a big part of it you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis theres a little bit more to show i got rhymes in my mind embedded

charts and those musicians curse at home but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone yeah they want reality but you wont hear none they rather exaggerate a little fiction some say no to drugs and take a stand but after the show they go lookin for the dope man oh they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to express yourself you might also like express yourself do it do express yourself oh do it  a lyricist yo dre is the name for it to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for kickin reality yo but staying hisself but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself from the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then expression is big part of it you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis theres a little bit more to show i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo or a lesson all of them expression and if you start

teenager before i had status and before i had a pager you could find the abstract listenin to hip hop my pops used to say it reminded him of bebop i said well daddy dont you know that things go in

room on the truckload of black boom listen to the rhymes then get a mental picture of this black man and black woman fixture why do i say that cause i gotta speak the truth man doin what we feel for the music is the proof and planted on the ground the act is so together bona fide strong you need leverage to sever the unit yes the unit yes the unit called the jazz is delivering each year an lp filled with street goods you can find it on your rack in your record store if you get the record say your thoughts are adored and appreciated cause were ever so glad we made it we work hard so we gotta thank god dishin out the plastic do the dance till youre spastic if you dissit gets drastic listen to the rhyme cause its time to make gravy if it moves your booty then shake shake it baby all the way to africa aka the motherland stick out the left then ill ask for the other hand thats the right hand black man only if you are noted as my man if i get the credit then i think i deserve it if you fake moves dont fix your mouth to word it get in the zone of positivity not negativity cause we gotta strive for longevity if you botch up whats in that  what a pair of nikes size ten and a half

is a  brother is a jerk leave em both alone and continue with your work whatever it may be in todays society everything is fair least thats how it seems to me you must be honest and true to the next dont be phony and expect one not to flex especially if you rhyme you have to live by the pen your man is your man then treat him like your friend all it is is the code of the streets so listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats beats that are hard beats that are funky they could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie what you gotta do is know the tribe is in the sphere the abstract poet
