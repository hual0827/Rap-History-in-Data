                <h5>Old-School Hip-Hop</h5>
                <p>
                    Old-school rap, which emerged in the 1970s and lasted through the mid-1980s, was the first style of
                    rap to
                    be recorded and gain mainstream attention. It began as a product of block parties in the South
                    Bronx, where
                    DJs would spin disco and funk records and MCs would rap over them. Some of the most influential
                    rappers of
                    this era include Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-DMC, and LL Cool J. Old-school rap is
                    often associated with disco, as many of the early rap tracks were based on disco beats, but it
                    quickly
                    evolved into a distinct genre with its own sound and style. The lyrics of old-school rap often dealt
                    with
                    partying, social issues, and life in the inner city, and laid the foundation for the socially
                    conscious themes
                    that would become a hallmark of later rap styles.

                <h5>Golden Age Hip-Hop</h5>
                <p>
                    Golden Age hip hop is often regarded as the peak of the genre, both in terms of creativity and
                    commercial success. It began in the mid-1980s and lasted until the early 1990s, with New York City
                    as its epicenter. During this time, rappers and producers pushed the boundaries of what was possible
                    with rap music, experimenting with sampling, drum machines, and other technologies to create unique
                    sounds and beats. Some of the most influential rappers of this era include Rakim, KRS-One, LL Cool
                    J, Public Enemy, and Big Daddy Kane, among others. Golden Age hip hop also saw the emergence of
                    female rappers like MC Lyte and Queen Latifah, who challenged gender norms and paved the way for
                    future generations of women in hip hop. The lyrics of Golden Age hip hop often dealt with social and
                    political issues, such as poverty, police brutality, and racism, making it an important tool for
                    cultural commentary and social change.

                <h5>Gangsta Rap</h5>
                <p>
                    Gangsta rap, or G-Rap, emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was characterized by its
                    gritty,
                    streetwise lyrics that often glorified violence, drugs, and gang culture. However, the content of
                    the lyrics also covers social and political issues - perhaps even more than Golden Age Hip Hop. The
                    genre was a reflection
                    of the harsh realities of life in inner-city America, and was driven by artists who had experienced
                    the struggles and violence of that lifestyle firsthand. Some of the most notable gangsta rap artists
                    of the time included N.W.A., Ice-T, and Tupac Shakur. The genre was controversial and often
                    criticized for promoting negative stereotypes and glorifying criminal behavior. Despite this,
                    gangsta rap had a major impact on the music industry and popular culture, and paved the way for the
                    continued evolution of hip hop.

                <h5>Crunk Rap</h5>
                <p>
                    Crunk is a subgenre of hip hop that originated in the southern United States in the late 1990s and
                    early 2000s. It is known for its energetic and aggressive beats, and its lyrics often center around
                    partying, drinking, and the "crunk" lifestyle. Crunk was popularized by artists like Lil Jon, Ying
                    Yang Twins, and Three 6 Mafia, who incorporated
                    the genre into their music. Lil Jon's 2002 album "Kings of Crunk" was a commercial success, and
                    helped to bring the genre into the mainstream. Crunk is often associated with the southern hip hop
                    scene, particularly in Atlanta and Memphis. It is also closely related to other subgenres like snap
                    music and trap music.
                    While crunk enjoyed mainstream success in the early 2000s, it has since fallen out of popularity.
                    However, its influence can still be heard in contemporary hip hop and pop music.

                <h5>Trap Music</h5>
                <p>
                    Trap music emerged from the southern United States in the early 2000s, with roots in Atlanta's
                    hip-hop scene. The term "trap" refers to the places where drugs are sold illegally, and the music's
                    lyrics often focus on the violence and drug culture found in these areas. The sound of trap music is
                    characterized by its heavy use of 808 drum machines, synthesizers, and vocal manipulations. The
                    genre rose to mainstream popularity in the mid-2010s, with artists like Future, Migos, and Young
                    Thug at the forefront. Trap music has since become a dominant force in hip-hop and pop music, with
                    its influence extending beyond the music itself to fashion and popular culture. Despite criticism of
                    its lyrical content, trap music has proven to be a reflection of contemporary society and a cultural
                    phenomenon that cannot be ignored.

                <h5>Drill Rap</h5>
                <p>
                    Drill is a subgenre of hip-hop that originated in the early 2010s in Chicago, Illinois. The style is
                    known for its dark and ominous beats, as well as its lyrical content, which often centers around the
                    harsh realities of inner-city life. Drill gained popularity through artists such as Chief Keef and
                    Lil Durk, who were able to turn their street experiences into chart-topping hits. The genre is
                    characterized by its stripped-down production style, heavy use of auto-tune, and aggressive
                    delivery. Drill has also influenced other subgenres such as UK drill and Brooklyn drill. Despite its
                    popularity, drill has faced criticism for promoting violence and glorifying criminal activity in its
                    lyrics.

                <h5>Mumble Rap</h5>
                <p>
                    Mumble rap is a subgenre of hip-hop that emerged in the mid-2010s, characterized by its heavy use of
                    auto-tune, mumbled delivery, and simple repetitive
                    lyrics. The subgenre's rise in popularity is closely associated with the streaming platform
                    SoundCloud, where many artists gained a following and launched their careers. Some notable artists
                    are Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, and 21 Savage.
                    Mumble rap has been met with mixed reception from the hip-hop community. While some fans appreciate
                    the subgenre's catchy melodies and youthful energy, others criticize the lack of lyrical substance
                    and the perceived laziness of the delivery. Despite this criticism, mumble rap has gained mainstream
                    success, with many of its artists achieving commercial success and topping the charts.

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">The Data</h5>
        <p>The dataset we used for this webpage consists of ~25 albums for each subgenre. The line between eras and
            subgenres can blur, so we tried to stick to the most clear-cut albums and artists for each subgenre. To
            decide on the most influential albums for each subgenre, we took various inputs from the internet - ChatGPT,
            Reddit, Wikipedia, and various other websites. Sometimes, albums belong to more than one subgenre. For
            example, Straight Outta Compton is classified as both golden age and gangsta rap. Some artists are
            purposefully excluded from the dataset because of the diversity of the songs in each of their albums. For
            example, any album by Jay-Z is hard to pin as gangsta rap because of the various themes and styles. Again,
            these are only a few of the subgenres of rap, and even the ones we discuss in this article can be split up
            into smaller subgenres (like my personal favorite, g-funk as a subgenre of gangsta rap).
            <br><br>
            To get the data on each of the albums, we used a python library called lyricsgenius and web scraped the data
            from Genius.com. All of the data visualizations were made with D3.js, a javascript library. Here is some
            more detailed information about each of the visualizations…
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Artist Bubble Chart</b> - The artists that go into these visualizations are based entirely off of the albums
                that went into the subgenre. The size of each circle is determined by the artist’s monthly listeners on
                Spotify as of April 2023. It is worth noting that the circles are sized relative only to the artists of
                the
                same subgenre. So, the size of a trap artist’s circle should not be compared with the size of an old
                school
                rapper’s circle. The circles are intractable if you click and drag them.
            </li><li>
            <b>Most Common Words</b> - These words were chosen through a technique called TF-IDF. TF-IDF (term
            frequency-inverse document frequency) in this context evaluates how important a word is to a subgenre
            relative to the rest of the subgenres. The metric is calculated based on the frequency of a word in a
            subgenre and its frequency in all of the other subgenres. So, common words that exist across all albums are
            automatically filtered out. Really, these charts show the most common words that are still fairly unique to
            that subgenre. The words in this chart are also interactable if you click and drag them.
        </li><li>
            <b>Sentiment Gauge</b> - To calculate the sentiment gauge for a subgenre, we used TextBlob, a python library, to
            get a sentiment score for each word from each album in a given subgenre. Then, we averaged those scores to
            come up with the final sentiment score for the subgenre.
        </li><li>
            <b>Topics Spider Chart</b> - To create this chart, we came up with lists of words likely to correlate with each of
            the topics. For example, our list of drug-related words includes “alcohol”, “xanax”, “weed”, etc. The
            algorithm goes through all the lyrics of the given subgenre and counts the number of times the rappers said
            a drug-related word. We then calculate the percentage of their lyrics that are drug-related so that
            subgenres with more/less lyrics are scored fairly.</p>
