freaks come out at night  discos dont open till after dark and it aint till twelve till the party really starts and i always had to be home by ten right before the fun was about to begin crowds of people lined up inside and out just one reason to rock the house but in the day time the streets were clear you couldnt find a good freak anywhere cause the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out the freaks come out at night  now when freaks get dressed to go out at night they like to wear leather jackets chains and spikes they wear rips and zippers all in their shirts real tight pants and fresh mini skirts all kinds of colors runnin through their hair and you could just about spot a freak anywhere but then again you could know someone all their life but might not know theyre a freak unless you see them at night cause  the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out the freaks come out at night  now the partys jumpin the place is packed and when the crowds like this im ready to rap but before i could bust a rhyme on the mic freaks are all over me like white on rice freaks come in all shapes sizes and colors but what i like about em most is that theyre real good lovers they do it in the park they do it in the dark but most freaks are known for breakin hearts you could never tell what a freak was thinkin of and you may never catch a freak without at least one glove and they dont walk when they step they strut and nine times out of ten they drive you nuts but take my advice you dont stand a chance freaks are so bad they got their own dance so if you wanna live a nice quiet life do yourself a favor dont come out at night cause you might also like the

most the time we use it in the wrong way now you can look the word up again and again but the dictionary doesnt know the meaning of friends and if you ask me you know i couldnt be much help because a friends somebody you judge for yourself some are ok and they treat you real cool but some mistake your kindness for bein a fool we like to be with some because theyre funny others come around when they need some money some you grew up with around the way and youre still real close to this very day homeboys through the summer winter spring and fall and then theres some we wish we never knew at all and this list goes on again and again but these are the people that we call friends when we first went out together we barely knew each other we had no intentions on becoming lovers but in no time at all you became my girl me and you one on one against the world talkin on the telephone for hours at a time or else i was at your house or you was at mine and then came the arguments and all kinds of problems besides making love we had nothing in common it couldve lasted longer because it started out strong but i guess we went about the whole thing wrong cause out of nowhere it just came to an end because we became lovers before we were friends  friends  how many of us have them friends  ones we can depend on friends  how many of us have them friends  before we go any further lets be friends  you say you and your girl friend were so tight you took her out with you and your guy one night she even had a set of keys to your home and you shared mostly everything you owned but as she shook your hand she stole your man and it was done so sweet it had to be a plan couldnt trust her with cheese let alone your keys with friends like that you dont need enemies you wonder how long it was all going on and youre still not sure if youre glad hes gone you say well if she took him he was never mine but deep inside you know thats just another lie and now youre kinda cold toward people you meet cause of something that was done to you by some creep but nevertheless ill say it again that these are the people that we call friends you might also like friends  how many of us have them

here well the hawk was out snows on the ground folks stayed in to party down the beat was thumping on the box and i was dancing in my socks and the drummer played at a solid pace and a taste of the bass was in my face and the guitar player laid down the heavy layer of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat and the guy with the 88s started to participate and i could sure appreciate a sound so sweet we were all in the mood so we had a little food and a joke and a smoke and a little bit of wine when i thought i heard a hoof on the top of the roof could it be or was it me i was feeling super fine so i went to the attic where i thought heard the static on the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in but the noise on the top was a reindeer clop just a trick st nick and i let the

a gift with a sift through his big red bags in the top or the bottom he reached in and got em toys for the boys for the girls glad rags and the grownups got some presents too a new tv and a stereo a new seville bout as blue as the sky the best that money couldnt buy cause money could never ever buy the feeling the one that comes from not concealing the way you you feel about your friends and this

theyd want to too if you jumped off a cliff theyd be right there as long as they could be like you they wouldnt care its sort of strange but it happens this way and you should know what im trying to say when suckers try to be like you all the time as if you and that person shared the same mind but i call em biters imitators copycats and duplicators no matter how you look at it they want to be just like you or maybe just like me but you have to be a biter to be like that theres no holding back im telling you flat you have to have a mind of your own stay off everybodys phone one day youll be all alone in your own little twilight zone  you are yo mixmaster what you say i said you are you might also like well im kangol and thats a fact and for some reason my names on everybodys hat one theme that i  tell me they didnt know that i was kangol from utfo but to be another kangol another kangol kid that would be irrelevant thats right thats what i said to be a mellow supreme the consequences are extreme not even mr rourke fantasize that dream when my mind goes wild my friends will all see i got finesse and im as cool as can be i survive in a fire like doc and e for being so extraordinary because my knowledge has shown that  until a year when mcs rock a microphone and from the day i was born never did nothing wrong just rocked all night to the break of dawn so you know im

im black and white right is that alright its alright so if its alright i guess i can rock you til im ready to stop to break or pop the way i feel now i just got to rock  rhymes like i pray i pray everyday cause i always got to have something new to say cause you always got the brothers with the negative minds saying man hes running the same ol rhyme and you know whos saying all of the biters trying to take credit from us writers i say a line they bite it and now they think theyre winning but the middles so fresh that they forgot the beginning then they try to bite it line for line but by that time im at the end of my rhyme but in this case bite it for me because its certified by doctor i c e so bite it embedthe real roxanne lyrics yo kangol yeah whats up girl im the real roxanne and ill rock your world but youre all stuck up well you say that cause i wouldnt give guys like you no rap  i was walking down the street in the afternoon i gave you a smile so you assume that if you said

kangol kid ya might be cute but you aint gettin this cause youre much too  you wear that samurai sword on the side i told all my friends and we all just died i laughed so hard that my face turned blue why be a mc you should learn kung fu and by the way if im such a crab why all your girls look like scabs first you call me a peach the doctor wants to take me to the beach i got a little rhyme for ya each ive seen your girls they both need a leash such bow wow babies i think they got rabies you think youre touching me boy you must be crazy you got your nerve to wanna be my man they call me the real roxanne roxanne cant you understand roxanne roxanne i wanna be your man  now educated rapper ima give you a fit cause when you tried to talk to me you was full of shit you see the truth and the fact is that i dont need you your iq is really one point two i dont like your rap cause your rap is dead educated rapper no sense in your head so when you met me i paid you no mind dictionary breath youre one of a kind you said your name was gary didnt choose to call you barry didnt care if your name was mother mata hari i choose to call you sonny because you have a tummy my fathers not a fairy youre the one who walks so funny your nose is always runny you look like bugs bunny all your raps are old ancient as a mummy your house is so scummy your clothes are so bummy but now with your hit record all i want is your money educated rapper you aint nothing but a dummy you try to be chummy all you plays gin rummy i bet makin love to you must really be crummy you say its customary to give your commentary i say its crap youre full of strawberries your rap is so weak and your face is so scary you always find a rap like yours in any cemetery so do you know you didnt even pass all you received was a kick in the ass thats what you get cause ive had enough aint that right mix master ice cream puff you might also like roxanne roxanne roxanne roxanne  when i heard this record i said whos the producers a group named full force a bunch of losers theyre a singin group so how should they know putting out records with utfo im whats happening i know thats a fact so utfobust that since im the new girl around the block the kangol kid and especially doc would like to sleep with me if he can but youre just a boy youre not even a man the girls know your name its getting around doctor ice youre the laugh of the town you tried to throw a game but it wasnt working out you lied about the beach you took me to your house i said me the rox give up the box so you could brag about it for the next 6 blocks shee you must be crazy youre goin too fast doctor i dont know where your hands been last you cant fool me cause down beneath youre a hood a crook a liar a thief i know how you operate from the start you like to breakdance and you like to break hearts so listen up cause i dont say this every day ho girl huh  the only operating that you do is ripping off cars in a minute or two you stole every last cadillac sold it back and kept the hubcaps you are the one you thought you had me roped but you hung yourself with your own stethoscope you said oooo now what the hell was that your voice ran high now it sounds real wack you call me at 900 to arrange a date i said meet me at the beach and dont be late so did you meet him at the beach hells no in the middle of december when its 20 below im the real roxanne roxanne i wanna be your man roxanne roxanne and heres our game plan  wheres the beat you guys cant deal it i need a man who can make me feel itembedcalling her a crab lyrics hey stupid yeah you roxanne get your face out the garbage can dont try to hide now since we made you a star come out and face it like the man you are  calling her a crab  well im the k a n g o l the k i d im on the mic rhyming well as you can all see i got a name of a hat as i recall roxannes grandmothers head is bald your fathers a crow your sisters hair wont grow your mothers always making like the wind that blows your brother never think i bet his drawers are pink as far as i know your whole family stinks so let the word spread that youre as good as dead from what your man told me youre no good in bed so keep this all in mind and dont step out of line cause i am the master of the rhyme they once locked a lady up until she escaped they wasnt sure what she was said she looked like an ape i thought they was exaggerating but i was wrong cause the lady looks more like a king kong eating her bananas swinging on vines hunters come along and then they snuff her from behind take her to the city and they put her in the zoo the lady gets pregnant and here comes you talking that mess thinking that youre great i knew all the time that your parents were apes if you didnt know baby that makes you one too so heres some bananas go home to your zoo find yourself a man not a fairy like your father i know youre trying hard but you gotta try harder cause calling you a crab is not a figure of speech youre not an apple or pear youre a bum on a beach shes such a crab calling her a crab shes such acrab  for some dumb reason you thought you were ahead but you put your big foot in your mouth instead and im about to end this tale in such a way it cannot fail you thought my name was larry but thats a joke that youll keep believing til the day you croak you said you love to marry but picture that on my kodak that would be wack your mothers name was mary and thats the truth she looks like a bigfoot and i got proof and as for you i just dont know your brain has gotta be filled with h2o you took our beat and made yourself famous and now youre gonna look like a great big anus what turns you on what makes you tick did you think for a minute you would be my pick that would be an idiotic move that i positively would never approve youre not bad looking i cant complain but youre a stupid knuckleheaded nincompoop without a brain youll probably stay a virgin til youre wrinkled and old somehow you think your body is solid gold i think ill do without instead cause theres nothing but rocks inside your head you talk a lotta feces youre full of waste matter and every roxanne that exists must scatter youre just a waste a big disgrace i think you better run and hide your face cause what we say will set it straight and dogs like you we eliminate and do you know to be honest and true i could never put up with a girl like you you might also like shes such a crab calling her a crab shes such acrab  give me a mic and a beat and ill be straight now with a crab that said i cant operate bitin ruins a person thats what it does but youll never be the man that your momma was you know if ugly was a burger youd be a big mac two all pork patties surrounded by fat theres one more thing that i forgot to mention your fathers so poor he cant pay attention you dont have enough money baby thats funny huh huh huh ha heeheehee heheehee honey whyd ya try to get loose on a doctor like me see i couldve helped your looks with plastic surgery remodel your nose theres a bump in the middle but to fix your whole face thats a medical riddle youre a living proof that they havent perfected the modern science of the birth control method crab andi dont usually break cause thats not my style but i figured this one was worth my while took off my doctors coat ran down the dark block spinned twice turned into the hood the rock now im stalking the street cause i was underestimated and now roxanne must be terminated what you said about the crew makes me sick so when i see you on a stage ima hit you with a brick boom ah right in your face and then the name roxanne will be a big disgrace see you failed to realize all our rhymes are polished so as im now running roxanne is demolished shes such a crab calling her a crab shes such acrab embedbody rock lyrics we got something new we got something new well if you rate it like you ate it like a movie review you see we get

and depressions that were all going through its nothing strange times are changin and it aint nothin new the presidency has a lot to do with our countrys wealth its nothin new its historys way of repeating itself now there is one conclusion i come to without a doubt thats if youre looking for a shortcut theres no easy way out and if you think the streets a way out just use your head you see three quarters are in jail and half the rest are dead because surviving on the streets there aint too many who can and the only who can is a real lucky man there arent too many of us lucky from the start you see because theres heavy odds against all minorities you might also likealthough theres heavy odds against us i still have to say that when  when theres a will theres a way but the strong will survive and the weak will die and the only ones who make it are the ones who try because we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can yes we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can i know we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can yes we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can a lot of people consider when you win as luck but it takes an innovative man to make a buck and id rather make a dollar just rhymin to the beat than hustling and scuffling out on the street well were not tryin to put nobody down if you do because we know you got to live this aint directed to you but younger brothers and the others that just dont know lifes hard enough as it is and thats the hardest way to go and when your mother cries and she begs you guys not to do it you dont listen and you dont realize until you have to eyewitness your best friend die then you open your eyes and think of all the reasons why the closest friend to you not here now then you wish you lived another life but couldnt see how because all of the time that you were saying that you cant there was no such word if you remember the chant yes we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can yes we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can i know we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can yes we can i know we can can yes we can can why cant we if we wanna yes we can can everybodys gonna break eve of destruction tax deduction price inflation rocks the nation and unemployments on the rise its all the final compromise and if it lasts like this for a long enough time it will lead
