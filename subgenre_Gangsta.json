class is in session so you can stop guessing if this is a tape or a written down memo see i am a professional this is not a demo in fact call it a lecture a visual picture sort of a poetic and rhythm like mixture listen im not dissing but theres something that youre missing maybe you should touch reality stop wishing for beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste if this meaning doesnt manifest put it to rest i am a poet you try to show it yet blow it it takes concentration for fresh communication observation that is to see without speaking take off your coat take notes i am teaching a class or rather school cause you need schooling i am not a king or queen im not ruling this is an introduction to poetry a small dedication to those that might know of me they might know of you and maybe your gang but one things for sure neither one of yall can hang cause yo im like a arrow and scott is the crossbow say something now thought so you seem to be the type that only understand the annihilation and destruction of the next man thats not poetry that is insanity its simply fantasy far from reality poetry is the language of imagination poetry is a form of positive creation difficult isnt it the point youre missing it your face is in front of my hand so im dissing it get get get down get get get get get get get down get down  scott la rock innovating decorating

queen or gang or crew or solo or team that i mean business so tell me what is this see i come from the bronx so just kiss this boogie down productions is somewhat an experiment the antidote for sucker mcs and theyre fearing it its self explanatory no ones writing for me the poetry im rattling is really not for battling but if you want i will simply change the program so when im done you will simply

hear a peep from a place called queens it was 76 to 1980 the dreads in brooklyn was crazy you couldnt bring out your set with no hip hop because the pistols would go gunshots so why dont you wise up

that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence until you have a chance to assess the situation you are confronted approach to danger dont move its hard to predict what would happen next oh shit

and growing like a tree and causing much destruction because im crushing complimented much yeah but never blushing hard like a criminal and im subliminal in my own right its dope cause im original funky unmistakably so when the vocals are done then you know its all a matter of setting a date for americas most complete artist but wait make sure you keep the facts in mind dont mess with the great cause the doc is like a nine with a voice telling you the bullets direction im talking murder but thats another section i need to explain while keeping my composure theres no jerking a sucker when he knows youre nothing but a villain and youll kill him so hes in fear but there aint no need in spilling your guts to a nut no i am not your equal meaning your equivalent im more like heaven sent i got it together so clever no one could sever remember this forever no one can do it better repeat 3x  knowledge is the key and hard work is the fee for me to be the great at the start and remain to be a threat til the opposition is warned taking as long as a song cause i was born with instincts to kill a grave mentality over the edge and you say you want to battle me at your own risk approach and be hosted and in the end you may win or be roasted but seeing its part of a game you think if you hang close to the one and youll claim but thats lame and im damn another loser without an apology so next

sense that youre accustomed i buy in the system with suckers smoothly bust them opposition is taken and thats a quote from the doc and the doctor cause this aint no joke so if you smile heres the

lyricsa child was born in the east one day moved to the west coast after his parents passed away never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats in poetry he was considered elite became a young gangster in the streets of la lost connections with his true roots far away but no matter the job or crime he never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme new yorks hip hop movement broke loose djs cut records raps had the juice since busting rhymes was his natural thing he was crowned the west coast mc king but after his inauguration there was a rush of wack rappers with one intention to crush this master rapper and take his throne a simple jobhe had no crew he stood all alone assassins came in groups of one through five with raps no mortal mc could survive but he showed no mercy he rapped blood thirsty battling from friday on through to thursday never losin a bout never ending in doubt every confrontation ko knock out on his never ending journey to the top the la player mc ice tyou might

l e s king word connector the vocal projector your girl tried to jock me i had to reject her always adventurous voice some say is sensuous now im on the mic so i think i better mention this i dont like gucci fila louis or fendi those are fads and i aint trendy but whether your names lucy terry laura or cindy ice got the beef and this aint wendys bust a move while im talkin sucker rappers i be stalkin when they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin they slow down turn around and ask was that ice then they see me cold countin my cash rhyme pays moves must be busted girls cant be

rhyme pays  im notorious im infamous like a snake im venomous for those who may diss i think you should consider this i can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle but this record is for radio s t e r e o its not to be banned or for some underground mix show my hearts in my pen every time i begin sometimes my lyrics go crazy and i just cant control em my friend i try to edit what im rappin about but i cant write polite my anger just jumps out perpetrators in the business claim theyre hard as hell talkin that gangster shit known theyre soft as jell  oh i better chill out before i ill out and my negative potential just might spill out and then this record wont be gettin played ill save that rap for another day you might also likerhyme pays  the front stage area goes into hysteria as i start to rhyme and unleash my criteria of what is to come during the beat of the drum and evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb using his intricate moves the record stays in the groove my boy cuts like jason its easy to prove that evil e is the great his cuts are real not fake not emulated effects or a play back tape so suckers witness your fate while evil demonstrates im bout to get off this mic e dog the break   kick it  like me if ya wanta diss me if youre gonna but my jam will still be kickin on your neighborhood corner as my

spell out my name ya go i c e t but right now its time for evil e to hit me rhyme pays buys my food every night and day it pays my rent my bills i guess im doin ok but when i say rhyme pays i mean in different ways cause rappin gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day it makes me feel real nice when someone likes the ice or some young mc asks me for advice but there will always be rappers who hate ice t maybe i dogged em in a battle or just jealousy inevitable situation sucker rapper frustration i rhyme too tough to bite too intricate for notation syllables jumble competitors crumble as they witness mic attack and the microphone rumbles like hurricane i maim sometimes i go insane step toward my rap and i inflict the pain no shame ice capital ts my name damn there i go illin out

never saw lights start flashing behind me but theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me but that shit dont work i just laugh because it gives them a hint not to step in my path for police

of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin but scared to kick reality man youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is so what you want me to do express yourself  im expressin with my full capabilities and now im livin in correctional facilities cause some dont agree with how i do this i get straight meditate like a buddhist im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary but my technique is very necessary blame it on ice cube because he says it gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one you know what i wont hesitate to diss one or two before im through so dont try to sing this some drop science well im

express yourself come on and do it  now gettin back to the pg thats program and its easy dre is back new jacks are made hollow expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words the style the trend the records i spin again and again and again  yo you on the other end watch a brother sayin dope rhymes with no help theres no fessin and guessin while im expressin myself its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be but not me ruthless is the way to go they know others say rhymes that fail to be original or they kill where the hip hop starts forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts some musicians cuss at home but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone yeah they want reality but you wont hear none theyd rather exaggerate a little fiction some say no to drugs and take a stand but after the show they go lookin for the dopeman or they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to you might also like express yourself yeah yeah yeah  express yourself come on and do it yeah yeah do it express yourself dr dre dr dre in full effect and nwa express yourself come on and do it express yourself  from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart then expression is a big part of it you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis theres a little bit more to show i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo or a lesson all of em expression and if you start fessin i got a smith & wesson for you i might ignore your record because it has no bottom i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn its dre on the mic gettin physical doin the job nwa is the lynch mob yes im macabre but you know you need this and the knowledge is growin just like a fetus or a tumor but heres the rumor dre is in the neighborhood and hes up to no good when i start expressin myself  yella slam it cause if i stay funky like this im doin damage or imma be too hyped and need a straitjacket i got knowledge and other suckas lack it so when you see dre a dj on the mic ask what its like  its like we gettin hype tonight cause if i

pad and pen and begin to write all kinda lyrics thats promised to play to make everybody say  they can be cold and ruthless no question about that but sometimes its more complicated yo dre you know what i want you to do bring that beat back bring that beat back now mc ren is here working like super glue no matter what i do im always stickin to you cause im the pusher supplying the fix and this jams so dope it dont need a remix but im making obstacles of enemy traps to catch any mcs with the weakest raps crucifyin in vain like just for usin my name the definition is pain but thats the thing o the game if they try to retreat i catchem one at a time cause theyre comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme so you in the back of me just listen and learn because youll all get a chance or

to kick reality ice cube yo dre youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is dr dre so watch do you want me to do  all you got to do now express yourself  im expressin with my full capabilities now im livin in correctional facilities cause some dont agree with how i do this i get straight meditate like a buddhist im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary but my technique is very necessary blame it on ice cube because he said it gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one you know what i wont hesitate to dis one or two before im through so dont try to sing this some drop science well im droppin english even if yella makes it a capella i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess cause its known to give a brother brain damage and brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin but makin a sucker and you equal dont be another sequel express yourself do it good express yourself oh do it  ice cube is not for the pop charts so where should a brother like you start expressin yourself my boyll show you how yo dre    what up   drop english right about now gettin back to the pg thats program and its easy dre is back   new jacks are made hollow expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words the style the trend the records i spin again and again and again yo ya on the other end watch a brother playin dope rhymes with no help theres no fessin and guessin while im expressin myself its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be but not me ruthless is the way to go they know others say rhymes that fail to be original or they kill where the hip hop starts forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts and those musicians curse at home but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone yeah they want reality but you wont hear none they rather exaggerate a little fiction some say no to drugs and take a stand but after the show they go lookin for the dope man oh they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to express yourself you might also like express yourself do it do express yourself oh do it  a lyricist yo dre is the name for it to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for kickin reality yo but staying hisself but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself from the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then expression is big part of it you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis theres a little bit more to show i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo or a lesson all of them expression and if you start fessin i got a smith&wesson for ya i might ignore your record because it has no bottom i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn its dre on the mic gettin physical doin the job nwa is the lynch mob yes im macabre but you know you need this and the knowledge is growin just like a fetus or a tumor but heres the rumour dres in the neighborhood and hes up to no good when i start expressin myself yella slam it cause if i stay funky like this im doin damage or imma be too hyped i need a straight jacket i got knowledge and other suckers lack it so when you see dre a dj on the mic ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight cause if i strike it aint for your good health but i wont strike if you just express yourself express yourself do it good express yourself oh
