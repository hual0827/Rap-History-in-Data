just a soul whose intentions are good oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as $39you might also like im watchin tv the other day right got this white guy on there talking bout black guys talking about how young black guys are targeted targeted by who america you see one in every one hundred americans are locked up one in every nine black americans are locked up and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail a young motherfucker to jail would be less to send his or her young ass to college see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack cocaine yeah stuff like that meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine the police are only i dont want to say only right but shit only logic by riding around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood and um you know the other thing is mostly foundyou know where im going but why bring a motherfucker to jail if its not gonna stand up in court because this drug aint that drug you know; level 3 level 4 drugs shit like that mhm i guess its all a misunderstanding and um i sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers you know that one in every nine we probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and its not like your suburbs we dont have the things that you have why i really dont want to know the answer but i guess we just misunderstood huh yeah you know we dont have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers the real criminals you know sex offenders rapists serial killers shit like that oh dont get scared dont get scared i know you saw one of them sex offender papers dont trip he live right on the end of your block mhm yeah that nigga live right down the street from you sex offender on the level 3 drug convicted ex con yeah check him out and what you got you got daughters son what you got yeah well you know what coughing dont stop the track thats the good weed you know what i have a fucking daughter you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me aint the reason why i live next door to him meaning he didnt rap his way to my fuckin neighborhood he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood you move him out bring him to jail for life and then you move in a sex offender hahaha then give me a paper haha is that a misunderstanding cause i dont understand it another thing let me take my glasses off cause i want to see the reaction on the faces when i say this uhh mr al sharpton heres why i dont respect you and nobody like you mhm see youre the type that gets off on gettin on other people haha thats not good no homo and rather un human i should say i mean given the fact that humanity well good humanity rather to me is helping one another no matter your color or race but this guy and people like him theyd rather speculate before they informate if thats a word haha you know spec before check anyway meanin id much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton haha hold on i aint finished wit you man gotta pluck the ashes mhm hold on um mr sharpton and anyone like you you dont know me so if youre not gonna try to then what you say or think about me or whatever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost to me and it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise doesnt necessarily make you a bad person neither but the characteristics fall heavily into bads way haha but since i am human i am good and bad as well but i try my hardest to stay good and some of the things i do and say may be bad or just not too good but i do try so with that said i dont fault you i mean youre only human good or bad but i also dont respect you and i dont care if thats good or bad haha you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me youre just another don king with a perm just a little more political and that just means youre a little un human than us humans and now let me be human by saying fuck al sharpton and anyone like him fuck if you understand me i love being misunderstood haha why cause i live in the suburbs but i come from the hood bring the hook in  but oh im just a soul whose intentions are good oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood37embedlollipop remix lyrics haha uh huh no homo young mula baby i say
